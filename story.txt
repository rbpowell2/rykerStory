There once was a puppy named Oscar. Oscar had a beautiful home and family, but there was one problem. Oscar's family decided to get a kitten, unaware that Oscar was terrified of kittens.

Roxin: Turns out the family confused the little kitten with a baby tiger, and in the beginning Oscar was doing great with the baby tiger. But then, (aight that's enough from me)

Murad: The cat and dog got along as all cats and dogs get along. The family was amazed and then deceided to get another animal which was a kangaroo named Steve Irwin (RIP).  

Nick: Unfortunatly, kangaroos dont do well as pets. Steve beat the **** out of the owners and they all had to go to the hospital. Steve was then subdued by animal control and sent back to australia

Kroikey mate! The morale of the story is to never confuse domestic animals with wild animals. Especially when those wild animals
are world class boxers...
